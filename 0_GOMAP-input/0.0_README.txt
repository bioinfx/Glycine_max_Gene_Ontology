/0.1_glyma.Wm82.gnm4.ann1.T8TQ.protein_primaryTranscript.faa.gz
     Primary transcripts for all protein coding genes in the Joint Genome
     Institute (JGI) Glycine Max genome assembly Wm82.a4.v1 (genotype
     Williams 82, assembly 4.0, gene model annotation 1.0).
     The file was downloaded in April 2019 from the LIS data store at
     https://legumeinfo.org/data/public/Glycine_max/Wm82.gnm4.ann1.T8TQ/glyma.Wm82.gnm4.ann1.T8TQ.protein_primaryTranscript.faa.gz

/0.2_remove_asterisks.sh
     Simple sed command to remove asterisks (*) at the end of the FASTA
     sequences which mark a stop codon but cause problems with the tools
     used in GOMAP. The resulting file 0.3_GOMAP-input.fa was used as the
     input for the GOMAP pipeline.

/0.3_GOMAP-input.fa.gz
     Result of applying the 0.2 script on the downloaded file 0.1, input
     for GOMAP.
