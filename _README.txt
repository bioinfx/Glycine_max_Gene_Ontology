This dataset generated by GOMAP is a high-coverage and reproducible functional
annotation set based on Gene Ontology (GO) term assignments that covers all
protein coding gene models in the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) Glycine Max 
genome assembly Wm82.a4.v1 (genotype Williams 82, assembly 4.0, gene model 
annotation 1.0) with a median of 11 annotations per gene model.
It was created in April of 2019.

For more information about the GOMAP pipeline, please visit
https://dill-picl.org/projects/gomap

Each of the following directories contains its own README.txt. Please refer to
that file for more details.
  
/0_GOMAP-input      The input for GOMAP: the peptide sequences we downloaded,
                    the script we used on them to generate the input for our
                    pipeline, and that script's result which is the GOMAP input.
  
/1_GOMAP-output     The functional annotation dataset as output by GOMAP,
                    follows GO Annotation File 2 (GAF 2) format.

/2_cleanup          Scripts and accompanying resources to clean, modify, and
                    complement the GOMAP-output to generate our final result.

/3_final-result     Cleaned annotation dataset. FINAL RESULT.
                    Follows GO Annotation File 2 (GAF 2) format.
                    Also contains a locus mapping to Wm82.a2.v1,
                    see README in that folder for details.

/4_make_GO_db       Making An Organism Package From Annotations Available From A Set Of Named Data.Frames.

files 0, 1, 2, 3 were downloaded from https://dill-picl.org/projects/gomap/gomap-datasets/
in file 3. The GO Annotation File 2 (GAF 2) was modified to remove errors in orinial one.
file 4 was newly added by myself.
