/2.1_modify_entity_names.py        Script to modify gene and transcript names
                                   in the output GAF file generated by GOMAP
                                   in order to comply with GAF specifications
                                   and provide more usable and simpler IDs than
                                   used in the input sequence keys.
                                   
/2.2_GOMAP-output-with-modified-entity-names.gaf.gz  Output from GOMAP with
                                   modified gene and transcript names.
                                   Follows GO Annotation File 2 (GAF 2) format.

/2.3_cleanup.py                    Performs cleanup on the generated GAF file:
                                    -  Removes obsolete Annotations 
                                    -  Merges GO terms to main term (alt_id->id) 
                                    -  Adds transcript variant to column 17 
                                    -  Changes assigned_by and db columns
                                    -  Removes duplicates

## Reproducing our results
If you want to reproduce our results, gunzip all gzipped files and execute the 
following commands

python 2.1_modify_entity_names.py ../1_GOMAP-output/1.1_GOMAP-output.gaf > GOMAP-output-with-modified-entity-names.gaf
python 2.3_cleanup.py GOMAP-output-with-modified-entity-names.gaf cleanup_resources/go.obo > final-output.gaf

The file `final-output.gaf` you generated this way should be identical to the 
final result file in `../3_final-result/`
We have also included the intermediary `2.2_GOMAP-with-modified-entity-names.gaf` 
file so you can check the first step on its own.
